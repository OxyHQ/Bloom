# Changelog

Releases before 15.50.0 are described in their pull requests and in git history.

## 15.50.1

### Fixed

- **select: the trigger's inner padding is back on Android.** The field's geometry (row, border, gap, padding longhands, min height per size) was only ever in classes, and in 15.50.0 Allo's "Raspberry + Antique Gold + Cobalt" sat flush against both ends of the pill. It is now inline as well on both forks, unless a caller `className` restyles the field; `fieldStyle` still overrides it. Shrink-to-line and truncation from 15.50.0 are unchanged.

### Consumers

Bump to 15.50.1. The chevron is `<SelectIcon />` inside `SelectTrigger`; a trigger that does not render one draws none (Allo's Appearance → Colour trigger has only `<SelectValue />`).

## 15.50.0

Six defects measured on Allo's Android release (Bloom 15.48.0, React Native 0.88 Fabric, Pixel 10 Pro / Pixel 8a).

### Fixed

- **portal (native): content keeps the React context of where `<Portal>` is written.** The native portal is a context + outlet, because `ReactFabric.createPortal` can only replace a whole root's children. The outlet re-rendered the stored element and re-published only Bloom's theme, so any provider between the app-root outlet and the portal was lost. Allo's Settings → Account crashed with `AlloSettingsProvider is missing`, while web (`createPortal`) worked. The portal now collects every context provider above it from its own fiber, subscribes to each, and the outlet renders the content inside the same providers. React Native's host-position contexts (text ancestor, ScrollView and VirtualizedList), the safe-area insets and frame, the portal's own contexts and Bloom's blur-window contexts are deliberately not carried. An update keeps the portal's place at the outlet, and it re-registers in a layout effect, so it lands in the same frame.
- **settings-modal: an open, idle modal no longer renders every frame.** The saved toast, which stays mounted at opacity 0 while the modal is open, centred itself with `marginLeft: -width / 2` taken from its own `onLayout`. Yoga's pixel rounding flipped that width by one device pixel back and forth forever: 601 frames in 5 s at about 146 % CPU, and uiautomator never went idle. A full-width row now centres it. A new gate replays Fabric's pixel grid and checks, over the modal and every `Dialog` placement, that no host's own `onLayout` moves or resizes that host.
- **settings-modal `SettingsRow`: a wide trailing control no longer crushes the label.** The row wraps in every layout, and the label column is `flexBasis: 0` plus grow plus `minWidth: 140`. The old `flexBasis: 140` never reached Yoga's wrap decision, because Yoga zeroes the computed basis of a row's only grow-and-shrink child. Allo's "Colour" chooser had squeezed the description to about 48dp, one word per line.
- **select: the trigger shrinks to its line and the value truncates before the chevron**, on both platforms (`flexShrink`, `maxWidth: '100%'`, inline value shrink).
- **chat-list `StoriesRow`: two separate strings for your own entry.** The avatar is drawn from `own.name` / `own.avatar` (the placeholder without them), and the caption is always `labels.own`. With no name, the avatar no longer shows the label's first letter ("Y"). Captions use the entry's whole slot (ring plus gap), and your own may wrap to two lines instead of showing "Your sta…". **Behaviour change:** an app that passed `own.name` now sees the label as the caption, not the name.
- **chat-list / mail-list rows: the pressed fill on native comes from Pressable's own `pressed` state.** It used to be a copy kept from press-in/press-out, and Android can drop the press-out when a tap opens a screen, so rows came back still painted pressed. Fixed for `ChatListItem`, `ArchivedRow`, the `ChatSearchResults` rows, `MailRow` and their icon buttons.
- **chat-people `ContactList`: sticky section headings are off by default on Android**, where rows rendered unpainted until the first scroll; `stickyHeaders` opts back in. The cause is suspected, not yet confirmed on a device: the layered (`zIndex`) sticky-heading wrappers between rows.

### Added

- `excludeFromPortalBridge(context)` (`@oxy.so/bloom/portal`): marks a host-position context so native portals leave it at the outlet's value. It returns the context.
- `ContactList layout="flat"` with `flatLabel`, for search results: one section, in the given order, with no A–Z rail and no sticky heading.

### Consumers

Bump to 15.50.0. No code change is needed. Allo can delete its sticky-heading workaround for search lists (use `layout="flat"`) and pass the account's display name and avatar to `StoriesRow`'s `own`.
